# CV-Based-Attendance-System

This project is an AI-powered face recognition attendance system that uses MTCNN for face detection and FaceNet for generating embeddings, combined with a deep learning classifier for recognizing individuals. It automates attendance marking by capturing images via webcam and logging attendance details into a CSV file.

# üöÄ Features

Face Detection: Uses MTCNN to detect faces from images or webcam feed.

Face Embeddings: Extracts high-dimensional embeddings using FaceNet.

Data Augmentation: Improves robustness with random transformations (rotation, zoom, shift, flip).

Classifier: Trains a neural network model on embeddings to recognize individuals.

Real-Time Capture: Integrates with webcam to capture live images for recognition.

Attendance Logging: Saves predictions (Name, Time, Date, Status) to a CSV file.
